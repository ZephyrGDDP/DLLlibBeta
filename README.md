# DLLlib
 A library of DirectX and VCRedist DLL files.
This library can be used to install DirectX 9, 11, and/or 12 without Administrator privileges, which is useful when applications or games require them but the installer is Admin-only.
How To Use:
Paste the DLLs you need into the folder that contains the app .exe file. If you don't know where it is, go to "help/findappexe.md"
